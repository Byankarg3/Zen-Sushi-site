# 🍣 Zen Sushi Website

A simple sushi restaurant website built as a learning project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔧 Features

- Clean layout with sushi-themed design
- JavaScript file included for basic interactivity

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring web pages with semantic HTML
- Styling with CSS flexbox/grid
- Linking external JavaScript for DOM interactions

## 🚀 Status

This is my first full website project — built by following a YouTube tutorial and learning web dev step by step. I'll customize it more as I improve!
